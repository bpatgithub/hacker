 Well, thank you, Lester,  thanks  Hstra for hosting us. I also want  see more companies do prit-sharing. If you help create  prits, you should be able  sh in m, not just  executives at  p. Well, I think that trade is an important issue. Of course, we  5 percent   world's population; we   trade with  or 95 percent. And we need   smart, fair trade deals. Well, let's sp for a second  remember where we were eight years ago. We had  worst financial crisis,  Great Recession,  worst since  1930s. That was in large part because  tax policies that slashed taxes on  wealthy, failed  invest in  middle class, ok ir eyes f  Wall Street,  created a perfect srm. Nine million people -- nine million people lost ir jobs. Five million people lost ir homes. And $13 trillion in family wealth was wiped out. I think science is real. And I think it's important that we grip this  deal with it, both at home  abroad. And here's what we can do. We can deploy a half a billion more solar panels. We can  enough clean energy  power every home. We can build a new modern electric grid. That's a lot  jobs; that's a lot  new economic activity. Well, actually... Well, actually, I  thought about this quite a bit. And I  -- well, not quite that long. I think my husb did a pretty good job in  1990s. I think a lot about what worked  how we can make it work again... ... million new jobs, a balanced budget... Incomes went up for everybody. Manufacturing jobs went up also in  1990s, if we're actually going  look at  facts. Well, I've been a senar, Donald... And I  been a secretary  state... And I  done a lot... Well, that's your opinion. That is your opinion. Well, that is just not accurate. I was against it once it was finally negotiated   terms were laid out. I wrote about that in... No. Well, Donald, I know you live in your own reality, but that is not  facts. The facts  -- I did say I hoped it would be a good deal, but when it was negotiated... ... which I was not responsible for, I concluded it wasn't. I wrote about that in my book... ... before you even announced. Look, re  differences... There ... There  different views about what's good for our country, our economy,  our leadership in  world. And I think it's important  look at what we need  do  get  economy going again. That's why I said new jobs with rising incomes, investments, not in more tax cuts that would add $5 trillion   debt. But in -- oh, but I do. In fact, I  written a book about it. It's called "Stronger Toger." You can pick it up morrow at a booksre... ... or at an airport near you. But it's because I see this -- we need   strong growth, fair growth, sustained growth. We also   look at how we help families balance  responsibilities at home   responsibilities at business. That can't -- that can't be left  st. I kind  assumed that re would be a lot  se charges  claims,  so... So we  taken  home page  my website, HillaryClinn.com,  we've turned it in a fact-checker. So if you want  see in real-time what  facts , please go  take a look. Because what I  proposed... ... would not add a penny   debt,  your plans would add $5 trillion   debt. What I  proposed would cut regulations  streamline m for small businesses. What I  proposed would be paid for by raising taxes on  wealthy, because y  made all  gains in  economy. And I think it's time that  wealthy  corporations paid ir fair sh  support this country. Well, at least I  a plan  fight ISIS. No, we're not. No, we're not. That's a -- that's -- go   -- please, fact checkers, get  work. I  a feeling that by,  end  this evening, I'm going  be blamed for everything that's ever happened. Why not? Yeah, why not? Yeah, well, let's start  clock again, Lester. We've looked at your tax proposals. I don't see changes in  corporate tax rates or  kinds  proposals you're referring  that would cause  repatriation, bringing back  money that's stred overseas. I happen  support that. I happen  -- I happen  support that in a way that will actually work  our benefit. But when I look at what you  proposed, you  what is called now  Trump loophole, because it would so advantage you   business you do. You've proposed an approach that has a... ... $4 billion tax benefit for your family. And when you look at what you  proposing... ... as I said, trumped-up trickle-down. Trickle-down did not work. It got us in  mess we were in, in 2008  2009. Slashing taxes on  wealthy hasn't worked. I don't think p-down works in America. I think building  middle class, investing in  middle class, making college debt-free so more young people can get ir education, helping people refinance ir -- ir debt from college at a lower rate. Those   kinds  things that will really boost  economy. Broad-based, inclusive growth is what we need in America, not more advantages for people at  very p. Well, I think you've seen anor example  bait-- switch here. For 40 years, everyone running for president has released ir tax returns. You can go  see nearly, I think, 39, 40 years  our tax returns, but everyone has done it. We know  IRS has made clear re is no prohibition on releasing it when you're under audit. Third, we don't know all  his business dealings, but we  been ld through investigative reporting that he owes about $650 million  Wall Street  foreign banks. Or maybe he doesn't want  American people, all  you watching night,  know that he's paid nothing in federal taxes, because  only years that anybody's ever seen were a couple  years when he had  turn m over  state authorities when he was trying  get a casino license,  y showed he didn't pay any federal income tax. So if he's paid zero, that means zero for troops, zero for vets, zero for schools or health. And I think probably he's not all that enthusiastic about having  rest  our country see what  real reasons , because it must be something really important, even terrible, that he's trying  hide. I do. You know, I made a mistake using a private e- mail. TRUMP: That's for sure. And if I had  do it over again, I would, obviously, do it differently. But I'm not going  make any excuses. It was a mistake,  I take responsibility for that. And maybe because you n't paid any federal income tax for a lot  years. (APPLAUSE) ... is if your -- if your main claim  be president   United States is your business, n I think we should talk about that. You know, your campaign manager said that you built a lot  businesses on  backs  little guys. Well, ... Do  thouss  people that you  stiffed over  course  your business not deserve some kind  apology from someone who has taken ir labor, taken  goods that y produced,  n refused  pay m? Well, sometimes re's not a direct transfer  skills from business  government, but sometimes what happened in business would be really bad for government. And we need  be very clear about that. Well, you're right. Race remains a significant challenge in our country. Unfortunately, race still determines o much, ten determines where people live, determines what kind  education in ir public schools y can get, , yes, it determines how y're treated in  criminal justice system. We've just seen those two tragic examples in both Tulsa  Charlotte. Right now, that's not  case in a lot  our neighborhoods. So I , ever since  first day  my campaign, called for criminal justice reform. I've laid out a platform that I think would begin  remedy some   problems we  in  criminal justice system. Well, I've heard -- I've heard Donald say this at his rallies,  it's really unfortunate that he paints such a dire negative picture  black communities in our country. You know,  vibrancy   black church,  black businesses that employ so many people,  opportunities that so many families  working  provide for ir kids. There's a lot that we should be proud   we should be supporting  lifting up. Lester, I think implicit bias is a problem for everyone, not just police. I think, unfortunately, o many  us in our great country jump  conclusions about each or. And refore, I think we need all  us  be asking hard questions about, you know, why am I feeling this way? They want support, y want more training, y want more assistance. And I think  federal government could be in a position where we would fer  provide that. Well, it's also fair  say, if we're going  talk about mayors, that under  current mayor, crime has continued  drop, including murders. So re is... No, I'm not. New York -- New York has done an excellent job. And I give credit -- I give credit across  board going back two mayors, two police chiefs, because it has worked. And or communities need  come ger  do what will work, as well. Well, I -- I do think... I think -- I think -- I think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate. And, yes, I did. And you know what else I prepd for? I prepd  be president. And I think that's a good thing. Well, just listen  what you heard. Well, I think cyber security, cyber warf will be one   biggest challenges facing  next president, because clearly we're facing at this point two different kinds  adversaries. There   independent hacking groups that do it mostly for commercial reasons  try  steal information that y can use  make money. ... ugh, long game here. And one   things he's done is  let loose cyber attackers  hack in government files,  hack in personal files, hack in  Democratic National Committee. And we recently  learned that, you know, that this is one  ir preferred methods  trying  wreak havoc  collect information. We need  make it very clear -- wher it's Russia, China, Iran or anybody else --  United States has much greater capacity. And we  not going  sit idly by  permit state acrs  go after our information, our private-secr information or our public-secr information. ...  said that Donald is unfit  be  commer- in-chief. It's comments like that that really worry people who underst  threats that we face. Well, I think re  a number  issues that we should be addressing. I  put forth a plan  defeat ISIS. It does involve going after m online. I think we need  do much more with our tech companies  prevent ISIS  ir operatives from being able  use  Internet  radicalize, even direct people in our country  Europe  elsewhere. Well, I hope  fact-checkers  turning up  volume  really working hard. Donald supported  invasion  Iraq. That is absolutely proved over  over again. He actually advocated for  actions we ok in Libya  urged that Gadhafi be taken out, after actually doing some business with him one time. But  larger point --  he says this constantly -- is George W. Bush made  agreement about when American troops would leave Iraq, not Barack Obama. Lester, we've covered... We've covered this ground. Whew, OK. That is not  right temperament  be commer-in- chief,  be taunted. And  worst part... ...  what we heard Donald say has been about nuclear weapons. He has said repeatedly that he didn't c if or nations got nuclear weapons, Japan, South Korea, even Saudi Arabia. It has been  policy   United States, Democrats  Republicans,  do everything we could  reduce  proliferation  nuclear weapons. He even said, well, you know, if re were nuclear war in East Asia, well, you know, that's fine... ...  a good time, folks. And, in fact, his cavalier attitude about nuclear weapons is so deeply troubling. That is  number-one threat we face in  world. And it becomes particularly threatening if terrorists ever get ir hs on any nuclear material. So a man who can be provoked by a tweet should not  his fingers anywhere near  nuclear codes, as far as I think anyone with any sense about this should be concerned. It's a good one, though. It well describes  problem. Well, let me -- let me start by saying, words matter. Words matter when you run for president. And y really matter when you  president. And I want  reassure our allies in Japan  South Korea  elsewhere that we  mutual defense treaties  we will honor m. ...  be given any opportunities at all. Well, one thing. One thing, Lester. You know, he tried  switch from looks  stamina. But this is a man who has called women pigs, slobs  dogs,  someone who has said pregnancy is an inconvenience  employers, who has said... .... women don't deserve equal pay unless y do as good a job as men. And one   worst things he said was about a woman in a beauty contest. He loves beauty contests, supporting m  hanging around m. And he called this woman "Miss Piggy." Then he called her "Miss Housekeeping," because she was Latina. Donald, she has a name. Her name is Alicia Machado. And she has become a U.S. citizen,  you can bet... Well, I support our democracy. And sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. But I certainly will support  outcome  this election.
