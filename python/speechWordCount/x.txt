 Thank you, Lester. Our jobs  fleeing  country. They're going  Mexico. They're going  many or countries. You look at what China is doing  our country in terms  making our product. They're devaluing ir currency,  re's nobody in our government  fight m. And we  a very good fight. And we  a winning fight. Because y're using our country as a piggy bank  rebuild China,  many or countries  doing  same thing. We cannot let it happen. Under my plan, I'll be reducing taxes tremendously, from 35 percent  15 percent for companies, small  big businesses. That's going  be a job crear like we n't seen since Ronald Reagan. It's going  be a beautiful thing  watch. Well, for one thing --  before we start on that -- my far gave me a very small loan in 1975,  I built it in a company that's worth many, many billions  dollars, with some   greatest assets in  world,  I say that only because that's  kind  thinking that our country needs. Secretary Clinn  ors, politicians, should  been doing this for years, not right now, because   fact that we've created a movement. They should  been doing this for years. What's happened  our jobs  our country  our economy generally is -- look, we owe $20 trillion. We cannot do it any longer, Lester. HOLT: Back   question, though. How do you bring back -- specifically bring back jobs, American manufacturers? How do you make m bring  jobs back? Well,  first thing you do is don't let  jobs leave. The companies  leaving. I could name, I mean, re  thouss  m. They're leaving,  y're leaving in bigger numbers than ever. That's called business, by  way. I did not. I did not. I do not say that. I do not say that. She talks about solar panels. We invested in a solar company, our country. That was a disaster. They lost plenty  money on that one. I will bring -- excuse me. I will bring back jobs. You can't bring back jobs. Yeah, for 30 years. Well, he approved NAFTA... He approved NAFTA, which is  single worst trade deal ever approved in this country. But you n't done it in 30 years or 26 years or any number you want ... You n't done it. You n't done it. Excuse me. Your husb signed NAFTA, which was one   worst things that ever happened   manufacturing industry. You go  New Engl, you go  Ohio, Pennsylvania, you go anywhere you want, Secretary Clinn,  you will see devastation where manufacture is down 30, 40, sometimes 50 percent. NAFTA is  worst trade deal maybe ever signed anywhere, but certainly ever signed in this country. You called it  gold stard. You called it  gold stard  trade deals. You said it's  finest deal you've ever seen. And n you heard what I said about it,  all  a sudden you were against it. Not. So is it President Obama's fault? Is it President Obama's fault? Secretary, is it President Obama's fault? Because he's pushing it. But you  no plan. Secretary, you  no plan. That's about all you've... You  going  approve one   biggest tax cuts in hisry. You  going  approve one   biggest tax increases in hisry. You  going  drive business out. Your regulations  a disaster,  you're going  increase regulations all over  place. Facts. And take a look at mine, also,  you'll see. Well, could I just finish -- I think I... I think I should -- you go  her website,  you take a look at her website. She's going  raise taxes $1.3 trillion. And look at her website. You know what? It's no difference than this. She's telling us how  fight ISIS. Just go  her website. She tells you how  fight ISIS on her website. I don't think General Douglas MacArthur would like that o much. No, no, you're telling  enemy everything you want  do. See, you're telling  enemy everything you want  do. No wonder you've been fighting -- no wonder you've been fighting ISIS your entire adult life. Well, I'm really calling for major jobs, because  wealthy  going create tremendous jobs. They're going  exp ir companies. They're going  do a tremendous job. Why not? There's nothing crazy about not letting our companies bring ir money back in ir country. Yes. Then you didn't read it. Who gave it that name? The first I've -- who gave it that name? How much? How much for my family? CLINTON: ... it is... Lester, how much? Typical politician. All talk, no action. Sounds good, doesn't work. Never going  happen. Our country is suffering because people like Secretary Clinn  made such bad decisions in terms  our jobs  in terms  what's going on. I don't mind releasing -- I'm under a routine audit. And it'll be released. And -- as soon as  audit's finished, it will be released. Excuse me. Well, I ld you, I will release m as soon as  audit. Look, I've been under audit almost for 15 years. I know a lot  wealthy people that  never been audited. I said, do you get audited? I get audited almost every year. It's not negotiable, no. Let her release  e-mails. Why did she delete 33,000... That makes me smart. That was more than a mistake. That was done purposely. OK? That was not a mistake. That was done purposely. When you  your staff taking  Fifth Amendment, taking  Fifth so y're not prosecuted, when you   man that set up  illegal server taking  Fifth, I think it's disgraceful. And believe me, this country thinks it's -- really thinks it's disgraceful, also. It would be squered, o, believe me. Maybe he didn't do a good job  I was unsatisfied with his work... Which our country should do, o. Wrong. Wrong. So, yeah, I think -- I do think it's time. Look, it's all words, it's all sound bites. I built an unbelievable company. Some   greatest assets anywhere in  world, real estate assets anywhere in  world, beyond  United States, in Europe, lots  different places. It's an unbelievable company. Well, first  all, Secretary Clinn doesn't want  use a couple  words,  that's law  order. And we need law  order. If we don't  it, we're not going   a country. No, you're wrong. It went before a judge, who was a very against-police judge. It was taken away from her. And our mayor, our new mayor, refused  go forward with  case. They would  won an appeal. If you look at it, throughout  country, re  many places where it's allowed. No,  argument is that we   take  guns away from se people that  m  y  bad people that shouldn't  m. You need better relationships between  communities   police, because in some cases, it's not good. But we need -- Lester, we need law  order. And we need law  order in  inner cities, because  people that  most affected by what's happening  African-American  Hispanic people. And it's very unfair  m what our politicians  allowing  happen. Ugh. I'd like  respond  that. First  all, I agree,  a lot  people even within my own party want  give certain rights  people on watch lists  no- fly lists. I agree with you. When a person is on a watch list or a no-fly list,  I   endorsement   NRA, which I'm very proud . These  very, very good people,  y're protecting  Second Amendment. No, you're wrong. You're wrong. Murders  up. All right. You check it. I'd like  just respond, if I might. I'd just like  respond. I will. Look,  African-American community has been let down by our politicians. They talk good around election time, like right now,  after  election, y said, see ya later, I'll see you in four years. And I will tell you, you look at  inner cities --  I just left Detroit,  I just left Philadelphia,  I just -- you know, you've seen me, I've been all over  place. You decided  stay home,  that's OK. But I will tell you, I've been all over. And I've met some   greatest people I'll ever meet within se communities. And y  very, very upset with what ir politicians  ld m  what ir politicians  done. I'll tell you very -- well, just very simple  say. Sidney Blumenthal works for  campaign  close -- very close friend  Secretary Clinn. And her campaign manager, Patti Doyle, went  -- during  campaign, her campaign against President Obama, fought very hard. And you can go look it up,  you can check it out. And if you look at CNN this past week, Patti Solis Doyle was on Wolf Blitzer saying that this happened. Blumenthal sent McClatchy, highly respected reporter at McClatchy,  Kenya  find out about it. They were pressing it very hard. She failed  get  birth certificate. Because I want  get on  defeating ISIS, because I want  get on  creating jobs, because I want  get on  having a strong border, because I want  get on  things that  very important  me  that  very important   country. Yeah. Well, nobody was pressing it, nobody was caring much about it. I figured you'd ask  question night,  course. But nobody was caring much about it. But I was  one that got him  produce  birth certificate. And I think I did a good job. Well, it was very -- I say nothing. I say nothing, because I was able  get him  produce it. He should  produced it a long time before. I say nothing. I would love  respond. First  all, I got  watch in preparing for this some  your debates against Barack Obama. You treated him with terrible disrespect. And I watched  way you talk now about how lovely everything is  how wonderful you . It doesn't work that way. You were after him, you were trying  -- you even sent out or your campaign sent out pictures  him in a certain garb, very famous pictures. I don't think you can deny that. I notice you bring that up a lot. And, you know, I also notice  very nasty commercials that you do on me in so many different ways, which I don't do on you. Maybe I'm trying  save  money. I do want  say that I was just endorsed --  more  coming next week -- it will be over 200 admirals, many  m here -- admirals  generals endorsed me  lead this country. That just happened,  many more  coming. And I'm very proud  it. You don't know who broke in  DNC. Well, first I   say one thing, very important. Secretary Clinn is talking about taking out ISIS. "We will take out ISIS." Well, President Obama  Secretary Clinn created a vacuum  way y got out  Iraq, because y got out -- what, y shouldn't  been in, but once y got in,  way y got out was a disaster. And ISIS was formed. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. Well, I   respond. The secretary said very strongly about working with -- we've been working with m for many years,  we   greatest mess anyone's ever seen. You look at  Middle East, it's a tal mess. Under your direction,  a large extent. No, wait a minute. When y formed, when y formed, this is something that never should  happened. It should  never happened. Now, you're talking about taking out ISIS. But you were re,  you were secretary  state when it was a little infant. Now it's in over 30 countries. And you're going  sp m? I don't think so. I did not support  war in Iraq. That is a mainstream media nonsense put out by her, because she -- frankly, I think  best person in her campaign is mainstream media. Just -- would you like  hear... Wait a minute. I was against  war in Iraq. Just so you put it out. The record does not show that. The record shows that I'm right. When I did an interview with Howard Stern, very lightly, first time anyone's asked me that, I said, very lightly, I don't know, maybe, who knows? Essentially. I n did an interview with Neil Cavu. We talked about  economy is more important. I n spoke  Sean Hannity, which everybody refuses  call Sean Hannity. I had numerous conversations with Sean Hannity at Fox. And Sean Hannity said --  he called me  or day --  I spoke  him about it -- he said you were tally against  war, because he was for  war. And when he -- excuse me. And that was before  war started. Sean Hannity said very strongly  me  or people -- he's willing  say it, but nobody wants  call him. I was against  war. He said, you used   fights with me, because Sean was in favor   war. No, no. You didn't hear what I said. Well, I  much better judgment than she does. There's no question about that. I also  a much better temperament than she has, you know? Wait. The AFL-CIO  or day, behind  blue screen, I don't know who you were talking , Secretary Clinn, but you were tally out  control. I said, re's a person with a temperament that's got a problem. That would not start a war. No, y were taunting us. Wrong. It's lies. That line's getting a little bit old, I must say. I would like ... It's not an accurate one at all. It's not an accurate one. So I just want  give a lot  things --  just  respond. I agree with her on one thing. The single greatest problem  world has is nuclear armament, nuclear weapons, not global warming, like you think  your -- your president thinks. Well, wait, but it's very important. All I said was, y may   defend mselves or y   help us out. We're a country that owes $20 trillion. They   help us out. As far as  nuclear is concerned, I agree. It is  single greatest threat that this country has. Well, I   say that, you know, for what Secretary Clinn was saying about nuclear with Russia, she's very cavalier in  way she talks about various countries. But Russia has been exping ir -- y  a much newer capability than we do. We  not been updating from  new stpoint. And y're going  end up getting nuclear. I met with Bibi Netanyahu  or day. Believe me, he's not a happy camper. Lester, one thing I'd like  say. I will go very quickly. But I will tell you that Hillary will tell you  go  her website  read all about how  defeat ISIS, which she could  defeated by never having it, you know, get going in  first place. Right now, it's getting ugher  ugher  defeat m, because y're in more  more places, more  more states, more  more nations. And it's a big problem. And as far as Japan is concerned, I want  help all  our allies, but we  losing billions  billions  dollars. We cannot be  policemen   world. We cannot protect countries all over  world... ... where y're not paying us what we need. And she doesn't say that, because she's got no business ability. We need heart. We need a lot  things. But you    some basic ability. And sadly, she doesn't  that. All   things that she's talking about could  been taken c  during  last 10 years, let's say, while she had great power. But y weren't taken c . And if she ever wins this race, y won't be taken c . She doesn't   look. She doesn't   stamina. I said she doesn't   stamina. And I don't believe she does   stamina. To be president  this country, you need tremendous stamina. You  -- wait a minute. Wait a minute, Lester. You asked me a question. Did you ask me a question? The world -- let me tell you. Let me tell you. Hillary has experience, but it's bad experience. We  made so many bad deals during  last -- so she's got experience, that I agree. I never said that. I didn't say that. Where did you find this? Where did you find this? Where did you find this? Oh, really? CLINTON: ... she's going  vote this November. OK, good. Let me just tell you... You know, Hillary is hitting me with tremendous commercials. Some  it's said in entertainment. Some  it's said -- somebody who's been very vicious  me, Rosie O'Donnell, I said very ugh things  her,  I think everybody would agree that she deserves it  nobody feels sorry for her. ... extremely rough  Hillary,  her family,  I said  myself, "I can't do it. I just can't do it. It's inappropriate. It's not nice." But she spent hundreds  millions  dollars on negative ads on me, many  which  absolutely untrue. They're untrue. And y're misrepresentations. ... $200 million is spent,  I'm eir winning or tied,  I've spent practically nothing. Look, here's  sry. I want  make America great again. I'm going  be able  do it. I don't believe Hillary will. The answer is, if she wins, I will absolutely support her.
