# Project Title

In machine learning, classification is used to classify a new observation into a specific set/category based on a training set of data containing observations whose category is known in advance.  The most common example is “spam” or “non-spam” classes for emails.  In E-Commerce, classifier algorithms can be used to classify sentiments of review based on words.  The specific words in the language are categorized in advance for their positive or negative sentiments.
Classification is an instance of supervised learning.  Training set has correctly identified observations.  Classifier algorithms are used to create cluster/sets from the uncategorized unsupervised data based on similarity and/or distance from the training data set.  

In simple classifier model, a simple count of positive and negative data points will define overall positive or negative sets.  There is a problem with this.  For example, in the case of words in sentences, “Great” and “Good” both are positive words.  But “Great” has a higher impact than “Good”.  We need to train our model to weigh identified data points.

Classifier model boundaries can be a simple line to separate “positive” from “negative” outcome to more complex hyperplane to separate multiple groups.
